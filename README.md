# Main Project: The Yuki-Game

'The Yuki-Game' is a fast-paced, arcade-style shooting game. Players control a character, a cat named Yukinator, whose mission is to defend against an onslaught of incoming vacuum cleaners. The player should not touch the enemies nor let them fly by. The game challenges players with increasing difficulty, requiring quick reflexes and strategic shooting. The game is developed in Python using the Pygame library.

- Increasing Difficulty: Enemy speed increases as the game progresses.
- Custom Graphics: The game features custom images for player, enemies, and bullets.
- Main Menu: Start and exit the game through a simple menu interface.
